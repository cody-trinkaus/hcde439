      <p>
        Pictured to the left is the schematic for my christmas light extravaganza!
        Because each light needed to connect to a pin be individually controlable, 
        I elected to build a parallel circut. I calculated the resistance for red LEDs
        to be 150ohm and for green LEDs, 100ohm. This informed my choice to use 220ohm 
        resistors for red LEDs and 100ohm resistors for green LEDs. In theory, any number
        of LEDs could be in this system, as only one pin will be powered at a time. The
        same amount of current would be drawn regardless of how many independently blinking 
        lights are in the system.

        To achieve the pattern in the gif, I used the following code. Through experimentation,
        I found that any blinking interval under 10ms appeared to stay lit up to the human eye.

        int timer2 = 300; 

        // The setup method initializes each pin as an output. 
        void setup() {
          // I used a for loop to initialize each pin.
          for (int thisPin = 9; thisPin < 14; thisPin++) {
            pinMode(thisPin, OUTPUT);

        This graph illustrates the change in voltage vs. time in the system.
